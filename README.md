# Personal Portfolio

![plot](./alain-portfolio.png)

This project is my personal portfolio where I share with the world a little bit about me as web developer. I also highlight some of the projects I have worked on in the past, some of the skills I have work with on a daily basis as a web developer. I also share some trainings I have attended in the past as well as my educational background.

The project is hosted with Firebase. Click here to view to check it out.
